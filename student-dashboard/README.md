This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## AI Features

This application uses OpenAI's API to provide several intelligent features:

1. **Story Analyzer** - Analyzes short stories to identify themes, tone, structure, and literary devices
2. **Thesis Builder** - Generates thesis statements based on essay type, topic, and supporting reasons
3. **Grammar Fix Tool** - Checks text for grammar issues and provides suggestions for improvement

⚠️ **Important Security Note**: Never commit your actual API keys to your repository. The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally exposing your API key. If deploying, use environment variables in your hosting platform instead of hardcoding keys.
